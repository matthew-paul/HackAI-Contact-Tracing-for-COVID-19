# HackAI-Contact-Tracing-for-COVID-19

## Inspiration
Contact tracing is a process used by public health ministries to help stop the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, within a community. Once a person is positive for coronavirus, it is very important to identify other people who may have been infected by the patients diagnosed. To identify infected people, the authorities follow the activity of patients diagnosed in the last 14 days. 

## What it does
Our application allows for users to make various queries to find students at UTD that may have been infected by another UTD student that tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. 

## How we built it
We used s(CASP) and Prolog for defining rules used to determine potentially infected students and if they are critical. 

## Challenges we ran into

## Accomplishments that we're proud of


## What we learned
We learned how to make more complex functions in Prolog and how s(CASP) works. We also learned a lot about the techniques for contact tracing used by authorities as we tried to mirror their logic in our application. 

## What's next for Contact Tracer
We can use actual data as our inputs instead of hardcoded facts. We can also develop a user-interface for our application so it can be easier and less confusing for users to make queries.
