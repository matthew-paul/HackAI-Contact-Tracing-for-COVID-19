# HackAI-Contact-Tracing-for-COVID-19

## Inspiration
Contact tracing is a process used by public health ministries to help stop the spread of infectious disease, such as COVID-19, within a community. Once a person is positive for coronavirus, it is very important to identify other people who may have been infected by the patients diagnosed. To identify infected people, the authorities follow the activity of patients diagnosed in the last 14 days. 

## What it does
Our application allows for users to make various queries to find students at UTD that may have been infected by another UTD student that tested positive for COVID-19 in the last 14 days. 

## How we built it
We used s(CASP) and Prolog for defining rules used to determine potentially infected students and if they are critical.
