Goal: automatically generate a list of potential students that were in close enough contact with the infected student

INPUTS:
    - Attendance list (inputted by professors)
    

SCENARIO 1: assuming that every student fills out the Daily Health Check survey.
    1) Check the dates on which the infected student was on campus.

            2.a) Check the classmates that went to those classes on those dates
                i) if Student X and InfectedStudent Y went to the same class at the same time 
                    if X_timestamp and Y_timestamp >= 15mins
                        then Student X is a potential covid patient. 
        3) Check the building that the student were in those dates
        4) If InfectedStudent Y is a commuter, 
            then go to step 2
            else get Roommate or Dormmate X of InfectedStudent Y 

    2) Get in-person events that infected students went in the past 2 weeks
